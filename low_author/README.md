# Low Author

An ExpressionEngine add-on to save an entry's author's screen name as a searchable channel field.

**Developed by:** <a href="https://github.com/low/" target="_blank" title="Lodewijk Schutte on GitHub">Lodewijk "Low" Schutte</a> of <a href="http://gotolow.com/" target="_blank" title="Check out Low's company!">Low</a>.

## Requirements

ExpressionEngine v2+

*Compatible with EE v2-5*

## Installation

- **EE v2:** Copy `low_author` directory into `/system/expressionengine/third_party/`
- **EE v3:** Copy `low_author` directory into `/system/user/addons/`
- **EE v4:** Copy `low_author` directory into `/system/user/addons/`
- **EE v5:** Copy `low_author` directory into `/system/user/addons/`

In your ExpressionEngine Control Panel, go to the Fieldtype Add-On Manager associated with your version of EE and find "Low Author" and install!

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a Low Author field to your channels. The field will show as a disabled text input and will contain the screen name of the author, or blank if it's a new entry.

Adding a Low Author field to an existing channel will auto-populate the field for existing entries.
